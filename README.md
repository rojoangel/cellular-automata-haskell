#Cellular Automata kata.

##Description

Most of us have probably heard of Conway's Game of Life, but there are other cellular automata that are equally interesting. In fact, there is a group of 256 one-dimensional cellular automata that are quite easy to simulate but still fun to observe.

These CAs have a number of simple "rules" that define system behavior, like "If my neighbors are both active, I am inactive" and the like. The rules are all given numbers, but they're not sequential for historical reasons.

So to simulate these elementary cellular automata, you first need to construct a rule table. This table is a description of the changes that happen in each discreet step of time. 

For instance, this is the table for the **Rule 30 automaton**:

    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Neighborhood    | 111 | 110 | 101 | 100 | 011 | 010 | 001 | 000 |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
    | New Center Cell |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+

and this is the one for the **Rule 90 automaton**:

    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Neighborhood    | 111 | 110 | 101 | 100 | 011 | 010 | 001 | 000 |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
    | New Center Cell |  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  0  |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
  
#Coding the CAs.

##1. CA evolution.

Given the rule, the **initial state as a list of 0s and 1s**, and **the number of evolution steps**, your program should return **a list with the states of the celular automata for the given steps (including the initial one)**. 

Example of calling the function:

    (evolve rule-90 [1 1 0 1 0 1 0] 5) => [[1 1 0 1 0 1 0]
                                           [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
                                           [1 1 1 0 0 1 0]
                                           [1 0 1 1 1 0 1]
                                           [0 0 1 0 1 0 0]
                                           [0 1 0 0 0 1 0]]
                                           
##2. Rendering the CA evolution.

Given **a list with the states of the celular automata for the given steps (including the initial one)** substitute the 0 with " " and the 1s with "X" and place each state in a different line.

For example: 

    (render [[1 1 0 1 0 1 0]
             [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
             [1 1 1 0 0 1 0]]) => "xx x x \nxx    x\nxxx  x \n"

If your program is ok, if you print the result of rendering the **Rule 90 automaton** evolution during 25 steps using the following input:

    00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    
you should obtain this [Serpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle):

                                                   x   x

                                    x x                             x x

                                 x       x                       x       x
                                x x     x x                     x x     x x

If you print the result of rendering the **Rule 30 automaton** evolution during 20 steps using the following input:

    00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    
you should see this other figure:
